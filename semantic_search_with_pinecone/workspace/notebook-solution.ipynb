Here we need to search based on _meaning_, not keywords. It is in these natural language queries—ie queries structured in the way we, as human beings, think—that we are able to retrieve the relevant document to our query.\n\nUse-cases for this type of search are broad, but a few of the most common we find for semantic search include:\n\n* **Document search**: a favorite use-case for organizations, particularly those with poor internal document discovery. Enabling their staff to find the information they need quicker is a huge optimization for many organizations.\n* **Chatbot knowledge training**: another very popular use-case with the rise of AI chatbots is the ability to augment chatbots or **L**arge **L**anguage **M**odels (LLMs) with external data. We use semantic search to retrieval this data—this process is commonly referred to as **R**etrieval **A**ugmented **G**eneration (RAG).\n* **Language classification**: by placing many classified sequences into a vector DB we are able to more quickly classify new sentences by simply comparing their semantic similarity to existing entries in the vector DB.\n* **Agent/chatbot safety**: an increasingly popular use-case for semantic search is to use it in chatbot safety—it functions similarily to language classification but instead focuses on identifying malicious or unwanted inputs / outputs between users and chatbots.\n\nThese are a few example use-cases of semantic search, there are many more out there in the world which you will undoubtable encounter and be ready to recognize after completing this chapter and gaining the skills and knowledge to build your own semantic search apps.","metadata":{},"id":"3fd8cccb-7f1b-407b-945e-d75cc7301186","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Before you begin","metadata":{},"id":"8231d2c6-275e-4399-b7cd-84e112831d08","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"You'll need to get an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and [Pinecone API key](https://app.pinecone.io).

Their hiatus saw the release of Beyoncé\\'s debut album, Dangerously in Love (2003), which established her as a solo artist worldwide, earned five Grammy Awards and featured the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\".',\n 'question': 'What areas did Beyonce compete in when she was growing up?',\n 'answers': {'text': ['singing and dancing'], 'answer_start': [207]}}"},"metadata":{},"execution_count":19}]},{"source":"# Print yet another element of data\ndata[500]","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":10,"lastExecutedAt":1742958557606,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Print yet another element of data\ndata[500]","lastExecutedByKernel":"474b8a72-a48b-4a74-ad5f-6c2136b0d5cf"},"id":"14e2443f-33c6-4c07-8996-b73a1ff466c0","cell_type":"code","execution_count":20,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"{'id': '56bfc281a10cfb14005512b6',\n 'title': 'Beyoncé',\n 'context': 'Beyoncé has received praise for her stage presence and voice during live performances.

He was also influenced by Hummel's development of virtuoso, yet Mozartian, piano technique. He cited Bach and Mozart as the two most important composers in shaping his musical outlook. Chopin's early works are in the style of the \"brilliant\" keyboard pieces of his era as exemplified by the works of Ignaz Moscheles, Friedrich Kalkbrenner, and others. Less direct in the earlier period are the influences of Polish folk music and of Italian opera. Much of what became his typical style of ornamentation (for example, his fioriture) is taken from singing. His melodic lines were increasingly reminiscent of the modes and features of the music of his native country, such as drones.\n[0.88]: Polish composers of the following generation included virtuosi such as Moritz Moszkowski, but, in the opinion of J. Barrie Jones, his \"one worthy successor\" among his compatriots was Karol Szymanowski (1882–1937). Edvard Grieg, Antonín Dvořák, Isaac Albéniz, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and Sergei Rachmaninoff, among others, are regarded by critics as having been influenced by Chopin's use of national modes and idioms. Alexander Scriabin was devoted to the music of Chopin, and his early published works include nineteen mazurkas, as well as numerous études and preludes; his teacher Nikolai Zverev drilled him in Chopin's works to improve his virtuosity as a performer. In the 20th century, composers who paid homage to (or in some cases parodied) the music of Chopin included George Crumb, Bohuslav Martinů, Darius Milhaud, Igor Stravinsky and Heitor Villa-Lobos.\n[0.88]: Two of Chopin's long-standing pupils, Karol Mikuli (1821–1897) and Georges Mathias, were themselves piano teachers and passed on details of his playing to their own students, some of whom (such as Raoul Koczalski) were to make recordings of his music. Other pianists and composers influenced by Chopin's style include Louis Moreau Gottschalk, Édouard Wolff (1816–1880) and Pierre Zimmermann. Debussy dedicated his own 1915 piano Études to the memory of Chopin; he frequently played Chopin's music during his studies at the Paris Conservatoire, and undertook the editing of Chopin's piano music for the publisher Jacques Durand.\n"}]},{"source":"### So who did influence Chopin?\n\nThe top result directly answers the question of who influenced Chopin.
